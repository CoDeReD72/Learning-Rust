fn main() {

    /* MEMORY AND ALLOCATION

    Data with a known size can be stored on the stack - Pushing data onto stack is faster

    Data with an unknown size must be stored on the heap - Finding space for data on heap is slower

    Values passed to functions are pushed onto the stack

    Values are popped off the stack once function is out of scope

    */

    /* OWNERSHIP RULES
    
    Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner

    There can only be one owner at a time

    When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

    Basically: variables/values only exist in the current scope E.g. function or block
